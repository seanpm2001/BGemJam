Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# BGemJam
BGemJam is a modern matching game similar to the Bejeweled series (since the Bejeweled games are getting very old, and losing support) I also feel like there should be an open source gem matching game. Candy crush is definitely **NOT** a viable replacement, and never will be.

***

## About

See above. This was the original old description for this project, but it still applies. Candy crush may be a viable replacement for some, but it isn't a viable replacement for the majority of Bejeweled/other gem matching game fans.

***

## Builds

There are no public builds of this game yet.

The website currently uses the Cayman theme, as it was the closest I could find to colorful gems on a default GitHub Pages Jekyll template.

***

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BGemJam/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## Sponsor info

![SponsorButton.png](SponsorButton.png)

You can sponsor this project if you like, but please specify what you want to donate to. [See the funds you can donate to here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Sponsor-info/tree/main/For-sponsors)

You can view other sponsor info [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Sponsor-info/)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
